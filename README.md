# lithuanian-parliamentary-election-data
This repository stores a cleaned up version of Lithuanian parliamentary election voting data. The original data sets are freely available from https://www.rinkejopuslapis.lt/ataskaitu-formavimas website. The original data sets were downloaded on August 31, 2016. Some minor issues were fixed (mismatched total votes counts).

This data set was studied in a forthcoming paper "Empirical analysis and agent-based modeling of Lithuanian parliamentary elections" (A. Kononovicius). You may freely reuse the data in your analysis. Refering to the paper is not mandatory, yet would be appreciated (citation instructions will be uploaded upon acceptance of the paper).
